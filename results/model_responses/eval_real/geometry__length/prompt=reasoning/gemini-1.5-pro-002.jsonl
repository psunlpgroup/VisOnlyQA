Then, provide the final answer (a, b, c, d, e).", "response": "Visually, AP appears roughly twice as long as the diameter of the circle. CB is a chord that is close in length to the diameter (although clearly shorter).  Therefore, AP appears to be roughly twice the length of CB.\n\nFinal Answer: (b)", "y_pred": "b", "y_true": "c"}
{"prompt": "Line CD is X times longer than BD. Which of the following options is a reasonable estimate of X? You only need to estimate from the visual information and do not need to do any mathematical reasoning. (a) 1 (b) 4 (c) 2 (d) 0.5 (e) 0.25 \n\nIn your response, provide a short explanation or reasoning for your answer. Then, provide the final answer (a, b, c, d, e).", "response": "Visually, BD looks about twice as long as CD.  Since CD is *X* times longer than BD, and CD is *shorter* than BD, *X* must be less than 1.  CD looks about half the length of BD.\n\nFinal Answer: (d)", "y_pred": "d", "y_true": "e"}
