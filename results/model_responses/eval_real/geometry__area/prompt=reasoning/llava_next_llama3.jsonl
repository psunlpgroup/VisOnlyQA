This is because triangle BEC is a smaller triangle with the same height as triangle ABC but with a base that is half the length of the base of triangle ABC.\n\nTherefore, the area of triangle BEC is half the area of triangle ABC.

However, we don't have the base or height information, so we can only make an estimate based on the visual information.\n\nFrom the image, it appears that the triangle is divided into two equal parts by the line that intersects at point \"O\". Therefore, the area of the triangle is equal to the sum of the areas of the two smaller triangles. Since the triangle is divided into two equal parts, the area of each smaller triangle is half the area of the original triangle.\n\nSo, the area of the triangle is equal to the area of the smaller triangle plus the area of the smaller triangle, which is equal to the area of the smaller triangle plus the area of the smaller triangle.
