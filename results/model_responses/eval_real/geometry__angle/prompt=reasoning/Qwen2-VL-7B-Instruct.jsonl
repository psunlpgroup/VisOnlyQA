Since we know the lengths of two sides of the triangle (8 and 7), we can use the Law of Cosines to estimate the angle.\n\nThe Law of Cosines states that for a triangle with sides a, b, and c, and angle C opposite side c, the following equation holds:\n\nc\u00b2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - 2ab * cos(C)\n\nIn this case, we can use the sides 8 and 7 to estimate the angle opposite side 7. Let's call this angle C.\n\n8\u00b2 = 7\u00b2 + 7\u00b2 - 2 * 7 * 7 * cos(C)\n64 = 49 + 49 - 98 * cos(C)\n64 = 98 - 98 * cos(C)\ncos(C) = (98 - 64) / 98\ncos(C) \u2248 0.3265\n\nNow, we can use the inverse cosine function to find the angle C:\n\nC \u2248 cos\u207b\u00b9(0.3265)\nC \u2248 70.5 degrees\n\nSince the angle TQP is adjacent to angle C, we can estimate that it is approximately 180 degrees - 70.5 degrees = 109.5 degrees.\n\nTherefore, the closest option to 109.5 degrees is (a) 180 degrees.\n\nThe final answer is (a).", "y_pred": "a", "y_true": "e"}
