Then, provide the final answer (True, False).", "response": "The chemical structure shown has two different groups attached to the cyclohexane ring: a methyl group (CH\u2083) and an ethyl group (CH\u2082CH\u2083). These groups are not identical, and their positions are not symmetrical along a horizontal axis. Therefore, the structure does not have reflectional symmetry along a horizontal axis.\n\nTrue.", "y_pred": "True", "y_true": "True"}
{"prompt": "The figure includes two hexagonal structures. True or False? You must answer this question using visual information and do not use knowledge of chemistry unless explicitly instructed to do so.\n\nIn your response, provide a short explanation or reasoning for your answer. Then, provide the final answer (True, False).", "response": "The figure includes only one hexagonal structure. The structure shown is a single six-membered ring, not two hexagonal structures.\n\nFalse.", "y_pred": "False", "y_true": "False"}
