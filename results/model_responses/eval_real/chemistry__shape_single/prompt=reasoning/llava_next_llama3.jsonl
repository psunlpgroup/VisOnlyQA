This indicates that CH2 is directly connected to CH3 with a single line, which represents a chemical bond. Therefore, the statement is true.\n\nExplanation:\nIn chemistry, a single line between two atoms represents a single bond, which is a chemical bond between two atoms that are bonded by sharing one or more pairs of electrons. In this case, the single line between CH2 and CH3 indicates that they are bonded by a single bond, meaning they are directly connected.", "y_pred": "True", "y_true": "True"}
