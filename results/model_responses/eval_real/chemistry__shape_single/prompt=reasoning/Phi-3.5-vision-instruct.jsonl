Then, provide the final answer (True, False).", "response": "The chemical structure does not have reflectional symmetry along a horizontal axis because the two sides of the molecule are not mirror images of each other. The left side has a CH3 group attached to the top carbon, while the right side has a CH2CH3 group attached to the top carbon. These groups are different, indicating that the molecule cannot be reflected along a horizontal axis to match both sides.\n\nFinal answer: True", "y_pred": "True", "y_true": "True"}
